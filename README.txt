This is a god-awful shooter I did in Unity. Not bad for a first attempt, but eugh. 
How could I have ever submitted this.

Controls self-explanatory. Just download as a zip, run the .exe. Boom.

NOTE: this was made in 2011, back when I had no idea what 'copyrights' were.
Suffice to say, music isn't mine. At all. It's off the Kingdom Hearts OST.
